## Auditory Brainstem Response Anaylsis in Matlab

This repository contains files for development of Matlab scripts for analysis of ABR data.

The current version is run as a GUI by calling `ABRanalyze` from the MATLAB command line. 
A dialog box will allow for selecting options/parameters, and choosing the location of the input data.
Input data are .txt files from BioSigRZ. Each .txt file should contain waveform data for one animal and one frequency,
with data for all stimulus levels for that frequency.
